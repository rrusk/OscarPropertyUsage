Note that OscarProperties extends the Properties class.  At the time
this README was written, it uses the parent Properties getProperty()
methods.  However, locating OscarProperties using the Abstract Syntax
Tree is more reliable if ASTParser is able to determine when
getProperty() is a method belonging to OscarProperties rather than
just Properties.  The file OscarProperties.patch adds the two
getProperty() methods to OscarProperties.  These methods are:

	public String getProperty(String key) {
		return super.getProperty(key);
	}

	public String getProperty(String key, String defaultValue) {
		return super.getProperty(key, defaultValue);
	}


Copy 'OscarProperties.patch' from this directory to the root of the
oscar git repository.  From there apply the patch using:

$ patch src/main/java/oscar/OscarProperties.java < OscarProperties.patch

OscarProperties are used extensively in jsp files so it is essential
that they can be parsed by ASTParser.  To make that possible, the
Eclipse build path of the Oscar repository being analyzed needs to
include the subdirectory "target/generated_jsp_classes" which is
created when Oscar is built using 'mvn clean verify'.  The
".classpath" file in the root of the Oscar git repository can be
patched to include the Java files generated from the jsp by adding

<classpathentry kind="src" path="target/generated_jsp_classes"/>

This can be done by copying the file 'classpath.patch' from this
directory to the root of the Oscar git repo and applying the patch:

$patch < classpath.patch
